# Example Data Plane Server
This directory contains a sample Data Plane Server which shows serving the tables in the CSV files in the data subdirectory. The main routine is in `presidential_elections.py` and it follows the pattern that DataPlane servers using the framework in data_plane_server.data_plane_server should: it registers the data_plane_server_blueprint, and then registers tables with the TableServer.  In this case, it uses the utility `data_plane_server.data_plane_csv_server.create_server_from_csv` to create the tables, but any form can be used.  Note that the server can serve tables derived from a variety of formats.
