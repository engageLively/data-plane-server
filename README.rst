A Python implementation of the Data Plane data structures, function, server, and client. This is a reference server and client for the Data Plane.  It demonstrates the Data Plane Server API.  It also functions as an open framework, so new Tables can be attached to the Data Plane server by providing a Class with a `get_rows()` method and a `columns` property.
