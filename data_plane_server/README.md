# Data Plane Server
This directory contains the modules that server data plane tables.  The principal module is table_server, that implements the middleware overlying a `DataPlaneTable` to support web services.  The principal class in table_server is `TableServer`, which implements a dictionary of Tables indexed by the table name, and supports methods which detail what tables are available under the authorization given and the schemata of those tables, what authorization is required for each table, the ability to add a data plane table, and methods which support the construction of filters over the hosted `Table`
The `TableServer` does not work with `DataPlaneTable`s directly, but with a containing class here, `Table`, which adds the ability to authenticate to use a `Table`.  `Table` also offers the ability to create a `RowTable` from a JSON specification.
In addition, table_server.py implements the self-explanatory `TableNotFoundException` and `TableNotAuthorizedException` exceptions.
data_plane_server is a reference implementation of a Data Plane server, implemented in Flask.  It implements all of the routes specified in the Data Plane specification.  The route / and /help prints a list of the supported routes.
The examples directory contains a simple use of the DataPlane Server and should be referenced for usage.
