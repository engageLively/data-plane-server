This generates the tests/filter_tests.py file, which is used to test  the primitive (IN_LIST, IN_RANGE, REGEX_MATCH)
filters of the DataPlane.  A test is a pair (filter_spec, expected_indices) and this code
generates a large set of those pairs  which are then used by the tester to do the actual tests.
The test is just instantiating the filter from the spec, running the filter on the table formed 
from the series in table_data_good.py
